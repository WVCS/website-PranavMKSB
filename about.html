      <h1>Who Is Pranav Muthukumaran </h1>
     <p> I have always been someone with a personality that is all over the place.<br> However, ever since I was young, I have always had a passion for learning<br> and developing my talent for critical and logical thinking. I have done a lot of<br> activities throughout my academic career.<br>

 <p> One of my most notable activities that I have participated in is FIRST Robotics<br> at Westview High School. As a veteran software student, I am in charge of the heavy<br>-weight programming of several robotics systems from arm mechanisms<br> to autonomous computer vision detectiont turrets<br> and ring shooters. In my time here, I have been able to serve on leadership roles<br> which have allowed me to grow my arsenal of skills in leading others<br> toward a common vision, my abilities to instill not only the skills needed for<br> software developement, engineering and robotics, but also<br>, the ability to think like someone in the field of technology and do things such as<br> use logical and critical thinking put together with creative problem solving.</p>
 
    <h2>Learning Online</h2>
 <p> Another one of my most important passions is learning by doing and innovative projects. Whenever I have the free time to do so, I take the chance to learn online through any resource that I can find. <p>
    
 <h2>Mark Rober Engineering Course</h2>

 <p> One great instance for my love to learn practical engineering is the time<br> when I took a creative engineering class/course that is<br> produced and directed by Mark Rober who is an ex Nasa and Apple<br> engineer that worked on the Mars Curiosity Rover. In this course,<br> I was able to learn underneath Mark Rober which is something that not everybody<br> can do and that is very special to me. In this course, I was taught the thought<br> process and steps to go from drawing board and ideas all the way<br> to the end product that can be showcased to the entire world. This course<br> consisted of three products that should have been designed, engineered and<br> built throughout the period of the course. The first build<br> was a mechanical engineering build without the help of electronics for the main<br> functionality or the purpose of the build. For this engineering build<br>, I designed and engineered a snack machine where I can easily access<br> my favorite snacks at a second's notice. The second build for this course<br> was an semi-autonomous robot that can go around a large poster paper<br> and generate art like it's easy using an arduino based microcontroller,<br> servo-motors and pre-loaded images that I can put in. The third build<br> that was done from this was a game that will reward you for memorizing formulas<br> with a candy prize. This used a Raspberry Pi with motors and programmed functionality<br> for the machine to work. Overall, the class/course provided me with a large set of skills<br> that I can use to tackle the engineering world.</p>
  
<h2>Chess</h2>

  <p> There is no way that Chess can be left behind from my list of interests/hobbies.<br>
      Since young adolesence, the intricate parts of the fantastic game of Chess has always been something that has piqued my interest. After learning how to play, I took the journy of playing game after game to improve my talent and ability to win games. I learned to play chess from my sister. We both had some free time that day several years ago so, we sat down and she showed me through example how each piece moves and even some tactics on how to win. Ever since I noticed that each piece in the player's army can move in unique ways, I knew that my mind composed of critical and logical thinking has this game in the bag. I strengthened my chess skills by self studying strategy on youtube, courses, apps and old fashioned chess books. Since I am busy throughout the day every day, chess.com is the community where I can play with people that have a similar interest in chess just like me. I will never forget chess and I do not plan on stopping to play chess.</p>
