      <h1>Who Is Pranav Muthukumaran </h1>
     <p> I have always been someone with a personality that is all over the place.<br> However, ever since I was young, I have always had a passion for learning<br> and developing my talent for critical and logical thinking. I have done a lot of<br> activities throughout my academic career.<br>

 <p> One of my most notable activities that I have participated in is FIRST Robotics<br> at Westview High School. As a veteran software student, I am in charge of the heavy<br>-weight programming of several robotics systems from arm mechanisms<br> to autonomous computer vision detectiont turrets<br> and ring shooters. In my time here, I have been able to serve on leadership roles<br> which have allowed me to grow my arsenal of skills in leading others<br> toward a common vision, my abilities to instill not only the skills needed for<br> software developement, engineering and robotics, but also<br>, the ability to think like someone in the field of technology and do things such as<br> use logical and critical thinking put together with creative problem solving.</p>
 
    <h2>Learning Online</h2>
 <p> Another one of my most important passions is learning by doing and innovative projects.<br> Whenever I have the free time to do so, I take the chance to learn<br> online through any resource that I can find. One of the most important things to me<br>that I have learned online is computer programming. Java is the most important programming language<br> to me for the sole reason that I have had so many good times with it. In the Westview<br> High School Option 16 Robotics team, we use Java for Robotics code development<br> and I use it as my primary language for building passion projects in my free time.<br> Another thing that I love to learn through online learning platforms is Astronomy,<br> Chemistry and Physics. Ever since a young age, these fields of science have always fascinated me.<br> One of the main catches and attractions for me to these fields of science is the fact that critical and logical thinking<br> are once again, integral to success in these fields. Some of the most popular places that I learn these<br> sciences online is YouTube, Coursera, edX and college websites for lectures<br> and projects. Overall, learning online is something that is valuable to me not only because I get to<br> improve my knowladge, but also because I can do it easily which is hard to find.<p>
    
 <h2>Mark Rober Engineering Course</h2>

 <p> One great instance for my love to learn practical engineering is the time<br> when I took a creative engineering class/course that is<br> produced and directed by Mark Rober who is an ex Nasa and Apple<br> engineer that worked on the Mars Curiosity Rover. In this course,<br> I was able to learn underneath Mark Rober which is something that not everybody<br> can do and that is very special to me. In this course, I was taught the thought<br> process and steps to go from drawing board and ideas all the way<br> to the end product that can be showcased to the entire world. This course<br> consisted of three products that should have been designed, engineered and<br> built throughout the period of the course. The first build<br> was a mechanical engineering build without the help of electronics for the main<br> functionality or the purpose of the build. For this engineering build<br>, I designed and engineered a snack machine where I can easily access<br> my favorite snacks at a second's notice. The second build for this course<br> was an semi-autonomous robot that can go around a large poster paper<br> and generate art like it's easy using an arduino based microcontroller,<br> servo-motors and pre-loaded images that I can put in. The third build<br> that was done from this was a game that will reward you for memorizing formulas<br> with a candy prize. This used a Raspberry Pi with motors and programmed functionality<br> for the machine to work. Overall, the class/course provided me with a large set of skills<br> that I can use to tackle the engineering world.</p>
  
<h2>Chess</h2>
  <br><img src = "https://cdn.hswstatic.com/gif/chess-4.jpg"></img><br>
  <p> There is no way that Chess can be left behind from my list of interests/hobbies.<br>
      Since young adolesence, the intricate parts of the fantastic game of Chess<br> has always been something that has piqued my interest. After learning how to<br> play, I took the journy of playing game after game to improve my<br> talent and ability to win games. I learned to play chess from my sister.<br> We both had some free time that day several years ago so, we sat down and<br> she showed me through example how each piece moves and even some tactics on how to win.<br> Ever since I noticed that each piece in the player's army can move in unique ways,<br> I knew that my mind composed of critical and logical thinking has this game<br> in the bag. I strengthened my chess skills by self studying strategy on youtube, courses,<br> apps and old fashioned chess books. Since I am busy throughout the day<br> every day, chess.com is the community where I can play with people that have a<br> similar interest in chess<br> just like me. I will never forget chess and I do not plan on stopping to play chess.</p>
