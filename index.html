    <h1>These are some of the projects that I have built on Code.org </h1>
    <p> Above are some of my projects that I have built through the code.org App Lab. In the first project,<br>sed a database of countries and territories, their respective flags and information about them such<br>the GDP per captia. The second app is called a multi-screen app. This app is purely just using<br>event handlers to adjust the result. In my app specifically, the user should answer a few questions by clicking<br>buttons that correspond to answers. The app then uses just the on-event handlers to decide on a place<br>t the user should travel to. In the third app, I use conditional statements inside of a function and parameters<br> that function to determine where a user should go for vacation based on factors like their style of vacation and budget.<br>rall, I put a lot of effort into these apps and I love that people will get to see them.<br></p>
