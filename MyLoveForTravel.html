      <h1>My Love For Travel</h1>
   <br><img src = "https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/traveling-based-on-fare-deals.jpg"></img><br>
      <p>My love for travel has existed ever since I have gotten into a car.<br> My parents have told me that even when I was really young, I have<br> always loved going to new places and exploring the scenery and meeting<br> new people. Throughout my life, I have traveled to a variety of places<br> that have enriched my experience and outlook on the world. During<br> and after each trip that I have taken, I have a perspective change<br> as I get to witness new cultures every time I can go somewhere new.<br> I am forever grateful for the opportunities that I have to travel<br> and whatever I picked up along the way is sure to stay with me forever.</p>
    
    <h2>Los Angeles</h2>

    <p>One of the most special places that I have traveled to is Los Angeles.<br> This is a destination that I have traveled far too many times to count<br>. In this city, there are so many cultures that are crammed into every street,<br> avenue, block and building and I wish that I could have seen all of them.<br> However, this goal is far to ambitious and LA will not let me or anyone else<br> accomplish this as Los Angeles is a ginormous city with culture that just<br> keeps growing. One of the most notable pieces of LA culture that I have seen<br> is Street Performance and Break Dancing. Even though LA is the home<br> of Hollywood and big TV and Movies is royalty in this city, a good street<br> performance still gives great entertainment and makes your day<br> that much more vibrant. One of the best Street Performance group that I have enjoyed<br> is Weezy and Brother from LA. These two brothers perform with heart and most<br> importantly, they have fun while doing it. During their performances, they have the audience<br> get involved in the entertainment which makes you feel like you are a part of<br> the performance. Another great part of LA is the Hollywood and the Hollywood<br> themed attractions and activities to partake in. I think that you can feel where this is going...</p>
  <h2>Universal Studios</h2>

  <p>You might have guessed it. Yep! It is Universal Studios! How could I not talk about Universal Studios when<br> I mention Los Angeles? I have visited Universal Studios a large number of times ever since I moved<br> to San Diego. Universal Studios Hollywood offers so many attractions and activities which in my<br> book, are things that are not okay to miss if and when you pop into Los Angeles. Some of my favorite<br> things to do in Universal Studios are too first ride the Jurasic Park Ride. This ride<br> is an icon that represents the heart of the thrill at Universal Studios Hollywood. Since the<br> LA Branch of Universal Studios is based off of Hollywood, this theme park incorporates all of the<br> vibrant ideas and thematic elements from all of our favorite American movies. Overall, Universal Studios<br> is a beacon of entertainment and vibrancy that lights up Los Angeles and this place will always hold a special place in my heart.
